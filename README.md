**INTRODUCTION**

This game is made of 6 classes including 5 classes such as Warrior, Mage, Archer, Paladin and The_great, and they are all acting as players while the last class is Evilwizard  which is the only one acting as the opponent. 

The main goal of the game is to use either one  in the 5 classes or players to defeatn the remaining class called wizard(the opponent).

All 6 classes are child classes(subclasses) of the main class(parent class) called "Character": Means, they have ability to use parent class methods such as attack and display_stats and attributes such as self.name, self.health, self.attack_power, and self.max_health

**HOW EACH OF THE 5 CHARACTER WINS OR GET DEFEATED BY THE WIZARD:**

*1. Warrior:*

The warrior's health is less than wizard's. However, warrior's attack_power is higher than the wizard's. The only way for the warrior to Win is by attacking without viewing stats. However, if the warrior attacks while viewing stats interchangeably, the wizard will take advantage by regenerating health and attacking the Warrior at the same time which will eventually increases his attack power and health to defeat warrior.

*2. Mage:*

The warrior and mage are both the same character. However, the attack power of Mage is higher than the Warrior's which make Mage defeat wizard faster than Warrior as long as it attacks consistently without checking the stats. 
However, if Mage choose to view stats while attacking interchangeably for the entire game, he/she will be defeated by the wizard.

*3. Archer:*

Interestingly, Archer's health and attack power is lower that that of of Wizard. Means, Archer will be defeated by wizard anytime attack method is used continously during the entire game.

In additon, Archer will even be defeated faster in case attack methods is used while view stats interchangeably during game.

However, Archer has the special ability. By using attacking method and special ability interchangeably, Archer's attack power become greater than that of wizard and will eventually deafeat the wizard.

*3. Paladin:*

Paladin is the same as Archer because his/her health and attack power is lower that that of of Wizard. However, he/she has also the special ability to self heal.

The game becomes more intersting for this character because he/she will need to self-heal mutiple time and attack multiple times to be able to win, otherwise he/she can be defeated by the wizard if he/she choose to use attack method only during the entire game.

*5. The_Great:*

 The_Great will quickly be defeated by the Wizard due to his/he very low health and attack power anytime he/she try to rely on using attack method only,

However, by using attack method, followed by using special force method  and a multiple times of times  of healing method will eventually defeat the wizard.

To know the game is ended, the defeat message will be displayed by showing wether the player or wizard got deafeated.
