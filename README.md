**INTRODUCTION**

This game is made of 7 classes. 1st Class, Character is a parent class while the remaining 6 classes are child classes(subclasses). All 6 classes inherit methods and attributes from Character class means they can use use both methods and attributes of the parent class at anytime. Parent class methods include attack, heal and dispalay_stats. Parent class attributes include self.name, self.health, self.attack_power,self.max_health.

The game is set up where 5 of 6 classes include Warrior, Mage, Archer, Paladin and The_great , and will be used in the place of a player individually. The remaining class IS called Evilwizard  is the only one acting as the opponent. 

The main goal of the game is to how to use either one  in the 5 subclasses or players to defeat/be defeated by the remaining subclass called wizard(the opponent).


**HOW EACH OF THE 5 CHARACTER WINS OR GET DEFEATED BY THE WIZARD:**

*1. Warrior:*

The warrior's health is less than wizard's. However, warrior's attack_power is higher than the wizard's. The only way for the warrior to Win is by attacking without viewing stats. However, if the warrior attacks while viewing stats interchangeably, the wizard will take advantage by regenerating health and attacking the Warrior at the same time which will eventually increases his attack power and health to defeat warrior. 

Also, using both attack method and speciall ability will defeat wizard faster. Warrior do not need to heal because incase both attack and special ability are used well can defeat wizard. 

Also, incase, warrior use attack method only the entire game, he/she has ability to spy on Wizard's secret only once. Trying to spy twice will lead to getting defeated.


*2. Mage:*

The warrior and mage are both the same character. However, the attack power of Mage is higher than the Warrior's which make Mage defeat wizard faster than Warrior as long as it attacks consistently without checking the stats. 

However, if Mage choose to view stats while attacking interchangeably for the entire game, he/she will be defeated by the wizard. Also, has Mage has ability to spy on wizard's secret just once throught the whole game and make sure attack method is used only to in order to win the game. 

Otherwise, Trying to spy more than once, he/she will be defeated because once you spy on 
Eviwizard's secret, wizard willl automatically use his/her own heal method which override character's heal method and has the ability to generate 30 health. Plus, he/she regenerate 5 more health and attack at the same time. AS a player, you lose more by trying to spy on Wizard.

*3. Archer:*

Interestingly, Archer's health and attack power is lower that that of of Wizard. Means, Archer will be defeated by wizard anytime attack method is used continously during the entire game.

In additon, Archer will even be defeated faster in case attack methods is used while view stats interchangeably during game. The defeat will be much worse and faster if Archer try to spy on wizard's secret just once.

However, Archer has the special ability. By using attacking method and special ability interchangeably, Archer's attack power become greater than that of wizard and will eventually deafeat the wizard.

*3. Paladin:*

Paladin is the same as Archer because his/her health and attack power is lower that that of of Wizard. However, he/she has also the special ability to self heal.

The same, he/she will be deafeated by wizard, if attack method is used only throught the game. Defeat will be fast and worse if Paladin try to spy on wizard at least once. 

The game becomes more intersting for this character because he/she will need to heal mutiple time and attack multiple times to be able to win, otherwise he/she can be defeated by the wizard if he/she choose to use attack method only during the entire game.

Moreover, my using heal method, palading can spy on wizard's secret at any time and still win in the game as long as heal method is used more times throughout the game before attacking or using special ability.

*5. The_Great:*

 The_Great will quickly be defeated by the Wizard due to his/he very low health and attack power anytime he/she try to rely on using attack method only, and will be worse if he/she try to spy on wizard's secret.

However, by using special tricks and healing method will eventually defeat the wizard much faster.The game will take longer if he/she try to spy on wizard's secret but as long as both methds are used interchaneably, The_Great will end up winning the game.

How you know the game is ended, the defeat message will be displayed by showing wether the player or Evil wizard got deafeated.
